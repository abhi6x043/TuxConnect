Currently, this project is under development. This is the basic part and it does its job well enough

There will be 3 programs/apps included in this package
1. Add an SSH connection
2. Connet to the remote server/machine with th already added connection
3. Getting the logs of the above two programs
Now, as this is the beginning stage, we have to manually enter the connection name to connect to the remote machine, which we have already added to our program.
The highlighting feature is the whole credentials and details entered cannot be tampered as it is AES256 bit ecrypted.

There's no third party APIs or other things used ithis program. Only GNU/Linux based programs available in their repective repos is used like python, bash etc.
