# TuxConnect
A Simple SSH Client Application Fully AES-256 encrypted

Coded by abhi6x043

Currently, this project is under development.
This is the basic part and it does its job well enough.
TuxConnect has been developed for Security and Simplicity. Unlike other SSH Client applications, 
TuxConnect encrypts the whole data related to a connection in AES-256 standard. 
Now it may not be feature rich, but in the near future you'll get the best thing you could expect.

There will be 3 programs/apps included in this package
1. Add an SSH connection
2. Connet to the remote server/machine with th already added connection
3. Getting the logs of the above two programs

Now, as this is the beginning stage, we have to manually enter
the connection name to connect to the remote machine, which we have already added to our program.

The highlighting feature is the whole credentials and details entered cannot be tampered
as it is AES256 bit ecrypted.

There's no third party APIs or other things used ithis program.
Only GNU/Linux  based programs available in their repective repos is used
like python, bash etc.

Currently, this is tested to LinuxMint 19 +
So, it should literally work in Debian/Ubuntu based systems. 
Packages for Debian/Ubuntu based and RHEL/Centos based distributions will be available soon

Kindly give executable permission to th install.sh script available and then run it.

chmod +x install.sh && sudo sh install.sh
